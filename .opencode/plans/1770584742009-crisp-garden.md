Goal: move EventService to common/service and append DomainEvent on CRUD mutations.

Scope files:
- packages/core/src/event/service.ts (move)
- packages/core/src/common/service/event-service.ts (new)
- packages/core/src/event/handler.ts
- packages/core/src/event/index.ts
- packages/core/src/rpc.ts
- packages/core/src/*/service.ts (CRUD services: policy, risk, issue, evidence, assessment template/instance, control, framework, comment, pdf, pdf-page)

Plan:
1) Move `EventService` to `packages/core/src/common/service/event-service.ts`. Keep API same. Update imports in `packages/core/src/event/handler.ts`, `packages/core/src/event/index.ts`, `packages/core/src/rpc.ts` and any new usage.
2) For each CRUD service, inject `EventService` and append after create/update/remove with `Event.makeEvent` from `packages/domain/src/event.ts`.
   - name format: `${entityType}.${action}`
   - entityType: lower-kebab slice (policy, risk, issue, evidence, assessment-template, assessment-instance, control, framework, comment, pdf, pdf-page)
   - action: created | updated | deleted
   - actorId/orgId: from `Actor.Actor`
   - revisionIdBefore: model.revisionId for update/remove; null for create
   - revisionId: new model revisionId after mutation
3) Ensure append uses same org/actor as mutation and returns unchanged service results.
4) Run `bun scan:fix`, fix issues.
